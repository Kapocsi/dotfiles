# Dot files

Mean to be used with GNU stow, used for managing dot files across my systems.
Or other files I need across everything

## Commands

This command does not work...
~~ For the sake of my own sanity, I am using the `--dotfiles` option, this allows ~~
~~ for use to to use the file path `dot-config` instead of `.config`. Because ~~
~~ having these files hidden inside of a editors/ls does not make sense here. ~~
