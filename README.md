# Dot files

Mean to be used with GNU stow for managing dot files across my systems.
Or other files I need across everything

## Commands

For the sake of my sanity, I am using the `--dotfiles` option, this allows to
use the file path `dot-config` instead of `.config`. Because having these files
hidden inside an editor's/ls does not make sense here.

There are quite a few templating things that manage the diffrenceces bettwen
macos and linux, make sure to run the `./build.sh`, I have not tested this on
any other system than what I run (Arch and Macos), your millage may vary.
