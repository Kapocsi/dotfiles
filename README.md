# Dot files

Mean to be used with GNU stow for managing dot files across my systems.
Or other files I need across everything

## Commands

This command does not work...
~~For the sake of my sanity, I am using the `--dotfiles` option, this allows~~
~~to use the file path `dot-config` instead of `.config`. Because~~
~~having these files hidden inside an editor's/ls does not make sense here.~~
